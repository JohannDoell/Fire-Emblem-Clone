Major Project Proposal for Computer Science 30

I am going to continue making the Fire Emblem clone that I was making
as a final project. I think this is much more challenging than my 
original idea of making a sort of mobile runner game-esque project, 
but not too challenging that I'd never be able to do it. I'll use 
Processing.

Needs
	- A basic movement system. (May 1st to May 11th)
		- Units cannot enter non-enterable terrain. (example: mountains, other units)
		- Units can only move a limited number of squares
	- A basic combat system. (May 13th to May 17th + May 19th to May 24th)
		- Select a unit and make an attack action to another unit.
	- Player vs. Player (May 25th to May 31st)
		- Turn system

(I'll reevaluate times once I'm done these three)

Wants
	- A combat system that incorporates elements of Fire Emblem's actual combat system.
		- So, a more complex combat system.
		- Takes offensive and defensive variables into consideration
		- Differing unit types.
	- Basic AI
	- Saving and loading by and to file.
	- More advanced movement system
		- Certain units can move into normally non-enterable terrain.

Pipe Dreams
	- Units that level up like an RPG
	- Different gameplay modes like story mode, challenge mode, etc.
