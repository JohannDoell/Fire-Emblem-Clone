# Major Project Proposal for Computer Science 30

I am going to continue making the Fire Emblem clone that I was making
as a final project. I think this is much more challenging than my 
original idea of making a sort of mobile runner game-esque project, 
but not too challenging that I'd never be able to do it. I'll use 
Processing and probably the minim sound library. As a clone, most
of this will be simply figuring out how to implement ideas, rather
than creating original ideas, which would streamline the process
a lot more.

## Needs
	- [x] Map system (Already have)
	- [x] Unit management system (Already have)
	- [ ] A basic movement system. (Week 1-2)
		- [ ] Units cannot enter non-enterable terrain. (example: mountains, other units)
		- [ ] Units can only move a limited number of squares
	- [ ] A basic combat system. (Week 3-4)
		- [ ] Select a unit and make an attack action to another unit.
	- [ ] Player vs. Player (Week 5)
		- [ ] Turn system
	- [ ] Code Clean Up (After Everything Else)

## Wants
	- A combat system that incorporates elements of Fire Emblem's actual combat system. (Moderate)
		- So, a more complex combat system.
		- Takes offensive and defensive variables into consideration
		- Lots of stats
		- Abilities, weapon types.
		- Differing unit types.
	- Basic AI (Lengthy)
	- Saving and loading by and to file. (Quick/Moderate)
	- More advanced movement system (Moderate)
		- Certain units can move into normally non-enterable terrain.
	- Graphics that aren't placeholders. Most likely assets from the games. (Quick/Moderate)
		- Would most likely just be spent trying to find the right files online.

## Pipe Dreams
	- Units that level up like an RPG
	- Different gameplay modes like story mode, challenge mode, etc.
	- Online multiplayer
