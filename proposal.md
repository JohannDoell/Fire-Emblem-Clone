# Major Project Proposal for Computer Science 30

I am going to continue making the Fire Emblem clone that I was making
as a final project. I think this is much more challenging than my 
original idea of making a sort of mobile runner game-esque project, 
but not too challenging that I'd never be able to do it. I'll use 
Processing and probably the minim sound library. As a clone, most
of this will be simply figuring out how to implement ideas, rather
than creating original ideas, which will streamline the process
a lot more.

I've put a basic timeline for the first phase. After that's done, I'll
evaluate the "Wants" section and see how much time I have left for what.

## Needs
- [x] Map system
- [x] Unit management system
- [ ] A basic movement system. (Week 1-2)
	- Units cannot enter non-enterable terrain. (example: mountains, other units)
	- Units can only move a limited number of squares
- [ ] A basic combat system. (Week 3-4)
	- Select a unit and make an attack action to another unit.
- [ ] Player vs. Player (Week 5)
	- Turn system
- [ ] Code Clean Up (After Everything Else)

## Wants
- A combat system that incorporates elements of Fire Emblem's actual combat system. (Moderate)
	- So, a more complex combat system.
	- Takes offensive and defensive variables into consideration
	- Lots of stats
	- Abilities, weapon types.
	- Differing unit types.
- Basic AI (Lengthy)
- Saving and loading by and to file. (Quick/Moderate)
- More advanced movement system (Moderate)
	- Certain units can move into normally non-enterable terrain.
- Graphics that aren't placeholders. Most likely assets from the games. (Quick/Moderate)
	- Would most likely just be spent trying to find the right files online.

## Pipe Dreams
- Units that level up like an RPG
- Different gameplay modes like story mode, challenge mode, etc.
- Online multiplayer
